# Chaos Protocol — Marketing Plan

## Core Marketing Insight

> This game **markets itself** through chaos. Every screenshot, every GIF, every stream clip looks insane enough to share. The strategy is: **make shareable moments, then put them where people can see them.**

---

## Brand Identity

### Tagline Options
- *"Every game you know. One board. Pure chaos."*
- *"Chess meets Minesweeper meets PvZ meets Battleship meets insanity."*
- *"The board game that ate every other board game."*

### Visual Identity
- **Color palette:** Dark background + neon accents (chaos = electric energy)
- **Logo:** A chess piece wearing a crown of other game icons (mine, card, ship, sunflower)
- **Tone:** Irreverent, absurd, self-aware. The game knows it's ridiculous and leans into it.

## Marketing Channels

### 1. Reddit (PRIMARY — Free, High Impact)

| Subreddit | Strategy |
|---|---|
| r/IndieGaming | Devlog posts, GIF showcases |
| r/WebGames | Post the playable itch.io link |
| r/gaming | Meme-worthy GIFs/screenshots of board chaos |
| r/gamedev | Development process posts, "how I built X" |
| r/chess | "What have they done to chess" posts |
| r/AnarchyChess | This sub would LOVE this game |
| r/ProgrammerHumor | "I combined every game into one" posts |

**Format that works on Reddit:**
- Short GIF (< 30 sec) showing a chaotic moment
- Title that hooks: *"I made a game where Chess, Minesweeper, and PvZ happen on the same board"*
- Comment with a link to play

### 2. Twitter/X (Viral Potential)

- Post regular **devlog GIFs** with hashtags: #gamedev #indiedev #indiegame #madewithphaser
- Create "WTF moments" clips — the algorithm loves absurd content
- Engage with other indie devs (retweet, comment, support)
- Post comparison shots: "Normal chess vs. MY chess"

### 3. YouTube / TikTok (Discoverability)

- **Short-form (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels):**
  - 15–30 second clips of the most chaotic board moments
  - "POV: you play chess but everything is trying to kill you"
  - Before/after: "What chess players think chess is vs. what my game looks like"
- **Long-form (YouTube):**
  - Devlog videos: "I'm combining every game into one board game"
  - Time-lapse of development
  - "I let my friend play and this happened"

### 4. Twitch / Streamers

- Chaotic games = stream gold (reactions, clipable moments)
- Reach out to small streamers (100–1000 followers) — they actually play submissions
- Provide a presskit with key art, description, and gameplay GIFs
- Multiplayer mode would be HUGE for 2-player streams

### 5. Discord

- Create a project Discord server
- Channels: #announcements, #devlog, #ideas, #bug-reports, #off-topic
- Let the community vote on which new game layer to add next
- Early access for Discord members builds loyalty

## Zero Budget Marketing Rules

1. **Never pay for ads** at this stage — organic only
2. **Every feature should produce a GIF** — if it's not GIF-worthy, it's not done
3. **Be genuine** — people can smell fake hype. Share real progress, real struggles
4. **Engage, don't self-promote** — be part of communities, not just posting links
5. **Make the game shareable** — end-of-match result screens, screenshot buttons, "share this insane board" features
