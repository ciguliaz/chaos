# Chaos Protocol — Sharing & Community Plan

## Philosophy

> *"Don't build in silence. Build in public. Let people see the chaos unfold."*

The game's greatest marketing asset is its inherent absurdity. Every development milestone produces shareable content naturally.

## Build In Public Strategy

### What to Share

| Development Moment | Shareable Content |
|---|---|
| Board renders for the first time | Screenshot: "Day 1 of building the most chaotic game ever" |
| Chess pieces move correctly | GIF: "Normal chess? Never heard of it" |
| Minesweeper fog added | GIF: "Added blind minefields to chess" |
| First mine explosion | Clip: piece walks onto mine → explosion effect |
| Cards added | GIF: "Now you can nuke an entire row mid-chess" |
| PvZ enemies added | Clip: zombies walking down while chess happens |
| Slot machine spin | Clip: "Gambled my Queen and lost her" |
| Everything at once | Screenshot: the full chaos board — the MONEY shot |

### Where to Share

| Platform | Content Type | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Twitter/X** (#gamedev) | GIFs, screenshots, dev thoughts | 2–3x/week |
| **Reddit** | GIFs with context, devlogs | 1–2x/week |
| **Discord** (own server) | Daily updates, polls, feedback | Daily |
| **TikTok / Shorts** | 15–30 sec chaos clips | 1–2x/week |
| **Mastodon** (#indiedev) | Same as Twitter, different audience | 1–2x/week |

## Streamer & Content Creator Outreach

### Target Streamers (Start Small)

| Size | Why | How to Reach |
|---|---|---|
| **Micro** (50–500 viewers) | More likely to try indie games | DM on Twitter/Discord |
| **Small** (500–2,000) | Good exposure, still accessible | Email with presskit |
| **Medium** (2,000–10,000) | Big boost if they feature you | Email, persistent follow-up |

### Outreach Template

```
Subject: Free game key — chaotic strategy game "Chaos Protocol"

Hi [Name],

I'm a solo dev building Chaos Protocol — a game where Chess,
Minesweeper, PvZ, and Battleship all happen on the same board
at the same time.

I think it'd make for a great stream/video because every
match produces absurd moments (I attached a few GIFs).

It's free to play in the browser: [link]

No pressure — just thought you'd get a kick out of it!

[Your name]
```

### Keys & Access
- Browser game = no keys needed, just share the link
- For Steam: generate keys via Steamworks → provide to creators

## In-Game Sharing Features

Build these directly into the game:

- [ ] **End-of-match result card** — shareable image with stats (pieces captured, mines triggered, cards played, chaos score)
- [ ] **Screenshot button** — captures the board state as a PNG
- [ ] **"Share" button** — generates a link or copies result to clipboard
- [ ] **Board replay** — save and share turn-by-turn replay
- [ ] **Chaos Score** — a single number representing how insane the match was (calculated from events triggered, pieces lost, gambles taken, etc.)
